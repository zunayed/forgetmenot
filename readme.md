`Forgetmenot`
=========

Unfortunately when a video you have favorited in Soundcloud or youtube is deleted it gets removed from all your playlist and you are not informed. All you are left with is a very unhelpful "video deleted" message. You can imagine for someone with a fair amount of favorites it would be quite difficult to know what video/song number 56 of 240 was. Thats where ForgetMeNot comes in.

It links into the Soundcloud & Youtube APIs and keeps records of your favorites. It will also show you which videos/audio have been deleted from your favorites and propose alternate links. 

Progress
- Oauth authentication for access to soundcloud api
- postgres database for users and their associated favorites database 
- sessions support
- abilty to search and filter your favorites

To Do 
- add youtube favorites support
